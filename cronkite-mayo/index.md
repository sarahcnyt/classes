## Presentations
* Powerpoint from class  - [Becoming a better watchdog](../docs/mayodata.pdf)
* The AP's Meghan Hoyer's health care [Datapalooza](../docs/meghan%20hoyer%20-%20USC_Oct_2017_Datapalooza_of_health_data_ideas.pptx)  from the USC health care fellowship, 2017 (with permission). Her [tip sheet](../docs/meghan%20hoyer%20-%20USC_March2018_Data_story_tipsheet.pdf) on sources is made for California reporters, but it will give you a sense of what's available elsewhere.

### Story examples

### Data compilations

* Look through [ProPublica's data store](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/datasets/health) for some cleaned datasets and links to other government sources. Start with "[Vital Signs](https://projects.propublica.org/vital-signs/)" data lookup, then consider learning how to use its API. 

* The mother of all regulatory sites: [reginfo.gov](http://reginfo.gov). Search to the "Information Collection" section. To reduce the number of results, use only "active" forms. (Video to come). While you're there, check out the "Unified Agenda" for any agency you care about. This is the list of upcoming regulatory and deregulatory actions, created for lobbyists to know what to expect in the future.

* [healthdata.gov](http://www.healthdata.gov) is supposed to be a compilation of all HHS datasets. Look at them by component for the easiest navigation. 

### CMS datasets 
(HHS's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services)

CMS's data sources are confusing. They could be found in [cms.gov](http://data.cms.gov), [medicare.gov](http://data.medicare.gov) or [medicaid.gov](http://data.medicaid.gov). 

**Standard provider level datasets**

* Hospital (Part A) utilization by hospital
* Provider (Part b) utilization by physician
* openpayments: Drug company and device payments to providers
* [Cost reports](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Downloadable-Public-Use-Files/Cost-Reports/Cost-Reports-by-Fiscal-Year.html) for Medicare-eligible institutions, including hospitals, nursing homes, renal clinics, home health care, and hospice. These are the reports that show whether they are making and spending enough to provide care. It includes general financial information on all of the institutions' activity, not just Medicare patients.

**Drug price and utilization**
[CMS drug spending](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Information-on-Prescription-Drugs/index.html) has average prices paid in Medicare Part D, Part B and Medicaid. It also has the most recent year total spending.
[data.medicaid.gov](http://data.medicaid.gov) has more details on drug utilization. 

**Nursing home inspections**
A lot of people use the CMS's Nursing Home Compare tool and data, but Propublica has made it much easier: Use its [Nursing Home Inspect](https://projects.propublica.org/nursing-homes/) tool, with downloadable data of unredacted inspection forms. It has documentation on sourcing and the meaning of the files.
