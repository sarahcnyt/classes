Her tip sheet on sources is made for California reporters, but it will give you a sense of what's available elsewhere.

### Story examples

### Data compilations

* Look through [ProPublica's data store](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/datasets/health) for some cleaned datasets and links to other government sources. Some of them are out of date, but they'll give you important context. Start with "[Vital Signs](https://projects.propublica.org/vital-signs/)" data lookup, then consider learning how to use its API. (This is a way to download a search result, which can be used in Google Sheets or Excel). 

* The mother of all regulatory sites: [reginfo.gov](http://reginfo.gov). Go to the "Information Collection" section and go straight to search. Look for keywords or browse forms from any federal agency. To reduce the number of results, use only "active" forms. (Video to come). While you're there, check out the "Unified Agenda" for any agency you care about. This is the list of upcoming regulatory and deregulatory actions, created for lobbyists to know what to expect in the future.

* [healthdata.gov](http://www.healthdata.gov)  was created in the Obama administration to compile a directory of all of the HHS datasets. It is hard to use, and often goes nowhere, but it gives you the names and units within HHS. It also provides the names of some datasets that are not public from the federal government, but could be public in your state.

### CMS datasets 
(HHS's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services)

There are several places to get started on Medicare and Medicaid data, and they make absolutely no sense. It may ask you to create a free account. This isn't something sinister -- there are two reasons for it. One is that you can filter and chart some of the data right online if you are logged in. The other is that you may have to agree to privacy conditions if you want to look at unfiltered patient or doctor level data. This is typical in health care and medical data.

If you can't find it on data.cms.gov, look in data.medicaid.gov or data.medicare.gov

**Drug price and utilization**
[CMS drug spending](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Information-on-Prescription-Drugs/index.html) has average prices paid in Medicare Part D, Part B and Medicaid. It also has the most recent year total spending.
[data.medicaid.gov](http://data.medicaid.gov) has more details on drug utilization. 

**Nursing home inspections**
A lot of people use the CMS's Nursing Home Compare tool and data, but Propublica has made it much easier: Use its [Nursing Home Inspect](https://projects.propublica.org/nursing-homes/) tool, with downloadable data of unredacted inspection forms. It has documentation on sourcing and the meaning of the files.

**Standard provider level datasets**

* Hospital (Part A) utilization by hospital
* Provider (Part b) utilization by physician
* Drug company and device payments to providers
* [Cost reports](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Downloadable-Public-Use-Files/Cost-Reports/Cost-Reports-by-Fiscal-Year.html) for Medicare-eligible institutions, including hospitals, nursing homes, renal clinics, home health care, and hospice. These are the reports that show whether they are making and spending enough to provide care. It includes general financial information on all of the institutions' activity, not just Medicare patients.
