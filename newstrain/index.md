### Download files:

Here are some Excel files we'll be practicing with in class:

* Phoenix [temperatures](../exampledata/phoenix_temperatures.xlsx) each day in 2017
* [Measles vaccinations](../exampledata/measlesvaccinations.xlsx) by school in Arizona, 2016-2017
* Opioid [emergency calls](../exampledata/opioidemscalls.csv), Tempe


### Learning Excel

* A [set of resources](https://sarahcnyt.github.io/data-reporting/practice) for learning Excel
* Consider [joining IRE](http://www.ire.org/join) and buying a subscription to NICAR-Learn, which has quick video trainings in all kinds of skills.


### What's next?

Once you get pretty good at Excel, you'll run into the biggest challenge most reporters face: extracting data from ugly forms and from the web.

* How to [deal with pdfs](https://sarahcnyt.github.io/data-reporting/assets/docs/pdf2xl). It's worth spending some money on a copy of software to help you. Really.
* [Simple scraping](https://sarahcnyt.github.io/data-reporting/assets/scraping/websources) and looking under a website's hood.
