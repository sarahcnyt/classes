<p>Example: Managed Long Term Care Enrollment reports.  Came from this site: <a href="http://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/managed_care/reports/enrollment/monthly/http://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/managed_care/reports/enrollment/monthly/">http://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/managed_care/reports/enrollment/monthly/</a></p>

<p>We had a very simple question, one that wasn’t worth very much work. Which had the biggest change?</p>

<p>##Step 1: Download all of the Excel spreadsheets and skip the pdfs</p>
<ul>
  <li>DownloadThemAll! as a Mozilla add-on is easy.</li>
  <li>Could easily be programmed in Python, Ruby or any other.</li>
  <li>If you’re good with command line tools: wget.</li>
</ul>

<p>##Step 2: Find the commonality among the sheets you want.</p>

<p>Look at some of the examples, go through a few years just to see if the format changed dramatically at some point. In some, the tab is called “Managed Long Term Care”, in others it’s called “Long Term Care”. We only care about the PACE programs, and they appear to always be in a sheet called one of those two things.</p>

<p>##Step 3: Combine them all into one sheet, stacked on top of each other. 
I determined that this was easier than trying to anticipate the exact form in a program. But how?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use Python or Ruby packages to copy and paste them into one sheet. _#fail__ .  There were errors in the files that prevented it - none of the standard packages would read these Excel files, I think because there were bad references in them.</li>
  <li>Write an Excel VBA program to do the same thing. That might have been easier, but I’m rusty at VBA. I’m sure I could have done it, but why?</li>
  <li>Seek out a tool to do the job. A Google search on “combine the same worksheet from multiple workbooks” yielded just the tool I needed: KuTools.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end I had a spreadsheet like this (I hid a bunch of rows in the middle):

<p>##Step 4: Make sure all of the sheets got copied
I actually had to go back and manually copy a few. What do you think an easy way to see whether I have every month might be? How would you filter to see what months were captured?</p>

<p>##Step 5: Now go to Open Refine for the dirty work
This could have been cleaned up in Excel using much of the same method we’re going to use in OpenRefine, but there are a couple of advantages.</p>

<ol>
  <li>OpenRefine saves all of your steps. If you have to troubleshoot the steps, you can always look at the diary.</li>
  <li>OpenRefine has quick commands to do common things that Excel doesn’t. It’s possible in Excel, but it’s a little more clunky.</li>
  <li>Regular expressions</li>
  <li>Once you’re done, it’s easy to standardize the company names.</li>
</ol>

<p>Watch out, though - Make sure that if you get it right, you don’t go back too far. You could write over the right ste</p>

<p>##Step 6:
Work out a strategy to refine it. You need to turn it into a database, not a report. This means keeping some of the totals, but getting rid of much of the summary; keeping a date next to each entry and distinguishing the PACE projects from the partial capitation.</p>

<p>Key commands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>value.match(<strong>regex</strong>) . (Note: OpenRefine requires wildcards before and after the phrase if they aren’t the beginnings and ends.)</li>
  <li>reversing the order permanently to fill down the totals, then reversing it back.</li>
  <li>Copying the original name and clustering to standardize.</li>
  <li>working out which rows to keep and which rows to trash. These can be regex filters or you can use the list.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once it’s out of open refine, you could bring it into something like Tableau Public to make this:
